This example shows you how to authenticate using the server flow.
You are stringly encouraged to read about the different authentication methods
at https://developers.podio.com/authentication to determine which is best for
your use.

To run this example:
* Follow the guidelines in the README to setup your configuration


To run this example you must perform some quick configuration. Follow these steps:

* Go to https://podio.com/settings/api and create an API client id and client secret. The domain you use must be the domain you will be running these examples under (the domain "localhost" will always work).
* Create a copy of the file config.sample.php and call it config.php
* Open this new config.php and fill in your client id, client secret and your Podio username and password
* Specify your REDIRECT_URI (the URL of this file) below
* Run this file in your browser.

 */

// Set up the REDIRECT_URI -- which is just the URL for this file.
define("REDIRECT_URI", 'http://localhost/podio-php/examples/server-auth.php');

  // Include the config file and the Podio library
  require_once 'config.php';

  // as constants in config.php
  Podio::setup(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET);

    // Use Podio::is_authenticated() to check is there's already an active session.
